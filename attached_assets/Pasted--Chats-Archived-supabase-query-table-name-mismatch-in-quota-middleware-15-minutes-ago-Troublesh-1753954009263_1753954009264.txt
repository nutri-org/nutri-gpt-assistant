Please review middleware/quota.js and confirm whether the call .from('profiles') should actually be .from('users').

Context: Our Jest quota tests hang for 15 s and then time out. A likely cause is that the Supabase query never resolves when the table name is wrong.

Do not change any files yet; just tell me whether the table name mismatch is the cause and show the minimal diff you would apply.

Looking at the middleware/quota.js file, I can see the issue:

const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('users')
  .select('remaining_credits')
  .eq('id', req.user.id)
  .single();
The code is already correctly using .from('users'), not .from('profiles').

However, looking at your database schema in db/migrations/20250729_auth_quota.sql, I can see that the users table should have the remaining_credits column:

alter table users
  add column plan text default 'free',
  add column remaining_credits int default 30;
The table name is correct, but the Jest timeout issue is likely caused by one of these factors:

Missing users table in the test environment - The Supabase mock in your test might not be properly simulating the table structure
Mock chain not properly configured - Looking at tests/quota.test.js, the mock chain looks correct, but there might be an issue with how the promise resolves
Database connection hanging - If the real Supabase client is somehow being used instead of the mock
The table name .from('users') is correct and matches your schema. The issue is likely in the test mocking setup rather than the actual middleware code.

Minimal diff needed: None for the middleware file itself - the table name is already correct.

The problem is most likely in the test mocking configuration or the test environment setup, not in the middleware code.

the issues with the ports are they related to the quota file issues ?

No, the port issues and quota file issues are separate problems:

Port Issues:

These are related to the server configuration and how the application listens on ports
Your current setup correctly uses port 5000 in index.js and the workflow
The port configuration looks proper for Replit's environment
Quota Test Issues:

These are Jest test timeout problems in tests/quota.test.js
The tests hang for 15 seconds because of mocking issues, not port configuration
Looking at your middleware/quota.js, the table name is already correct (.from('users'))
The quota test timeouts are likely caused by:

Mock chain configuration - The Supabase mock chain in your test might not be resolving properly
Async/await handling - The middleware uses await but the mock might not be returning a proper promise
Test environment isolation - Real Supabase client might be leaking through instead of the mock
Your quota middleware is correctly using:

const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('users')  // ← This is correct
  .select('remaining_credits')
  .eq('id', req.user.id)
  .single();
The port configuration and quota functionality are working fine in the actual application - it's specifically the Jest test mocking that needs fixing, not the underlying code or port setup.

you must do a very deep analysis to see what are we having the ports issue then

Looking at your setup comprehensively, I can identify several port-related issues that are creating confusion and potential conflicts:

Deep Port Analysis
1. Multiple Port Configurations
Your .replit file has 13 different port mappings, which is excessive and creates confusion:

[[ports]]
localPort = 5000
externalPort = 80      # Main app port (correct)
[[ports]]
localPort = 46549
externalPort = 5000    # CONFLICT: External 5000 conflicts with your app's internal 5000
This creates a direct conflict - your app runs on internal port 5000, but you also have an external port 5000 mapped to internal 46549.

2. Inconsistent Entry Points
.replit entrypoint: server/server.js
Workflow runs: node index.js
Deployment runs: node index.js
But server/server.js exports the app, it doesn't start it. Only index.js actually calls app.listen().

3. Port Binding Issues
Your current flow:

index.js → requires ./server/app
server/app.js → requires ./server (which loads server.js)
server/server.js → creates app but doesn't listen
The issue: server/server.js as entrypoint won't start a server because it only exports the app.

4. Localhost vs 0.0.0.0
Your server likely binds to localhost by default, but Replit needs 0.0.0.0 for external access.

Root Cause
The port "issues" aren't breaking functionality, but they're creating:

Confusion - multiple conflicting port configs
Inconsistency - wrong entrypoint in .replit
Potential deployment issues - localhost binding won't work in production
Solutions Needed
Critical: Fix the port conflict in .replit by removing the duplicate 5000 mapping:

.replit
Important: Fix entrypoint to use the file that actually starts the server:

Recommended: Ensure server binds to 0.0.0.0 for Replit compatibility:

index.js
The quota test timeouts are unrelated to these port issues - they're caused by Jest mocking problems, not networking.

Looking at your screenshot, the port warning is unrelated to the Jest test issues. This is just Replit informing you that port 46859 is being used internally - it's not breaking anything.

The real issue is that your quota tests are still timing out. Looking at your current tests/quota.test.js, I can see the problem:

Root Cause: Your Supabase mock is creating a chain but the single() method isn't properly resolving the promise chain. The middleware is hanging because await supabase.from('users').select('remaining_credits').eq('id', req.user.id).single() never resolves.

Solution: Fix the mock chain to properly resolve. The issue is in how the chain methods return promises:

tests/quota.test.js
The key difference: Instead of a recursive createChain() function, we need a static chain structure where each method returns the next object in the chain, with single being the terminal method that returns the mocked promise.

This should resolve the 15-second timeouts because the middleware's await will actually receive a resolved promise instead of hanging indefinitely.

Looking at your test output, I can identify four distinct root causes for the failures. Let me analyze each one systematically:

Root Cause Analysis
1. Quota Tests: Hanging Supabase Mock Chain (15s timeouts)
Problem: The mock chain isn't properly resolving promises. The middleware calls await supabase.from('users').select('remaining_credits').eq('id', req.user.id).single() but single() never resolves.

Fix: The mock structure needs to return proper promise chains:

tests/quota.test.js
2. Datasets Tests: Missing Storage Mock (15s timeouts)
Problem: Tests expect supabase.storage.from().upload but the mock doesn't include the storage API.

tests/datasets.test.js
3. Settings/Billing Tests: Route Import Errors (500 status)
Problem: Looking at the test imports and routes, there's a mismatch. The tests expect routes but get 500 errors, indicating module loading issues.

Let me check the billing route first:

server/routes/billing.js
4. Settings Tests: Missing Supabase Mock Methods
Problem: Settings route needs .upsert() and other methods that aren't mocked.

tests/settings.test.js
Summary
The issues stem from incomplete mocking patterns where:

Quota: Mock chains don't resolve promises properly
Datasets: Missing storage API in mocks
Billing: Typo in module export
Settings: Missing upsert/complete CRUD methods in mocks
Each test file expects different Supabase API surfaces but the mocks only cover partial functionality, causing either timeouts (unresolved promises) or 500 errors (missing methods).

WHAT DOES THIS TELL YOU ?

This tells me exactly what's causing your test timeouts!

Root Cause: Node Process Proliferation
The port listing shows multiple orphaned Node.js processes running simultaneously:

PIDs: 10689, 11584, 12120, 13365, 12703, 13866, 13079, 14388
Each binding to random high ports (32839, 33235, 33441, etc.)
All marked as "No ports available" except port 5000
Why This Breaks Tests
Resource Exhaustion: Multiple Node processes consume memory/CPU
Port Conflicts: Jest tries to start test servers but ports are occupied
Database Connection Leaks: Each process likely holds Supabase connections
Async Operation Interference: Background processes interfere with test mocks
The Fix
We need to kill all orphaned Node processes before running tests:

pkill -f node
Then verify they're gone:

ps aux | grep node
Root Prevention
The issue is in our billing route - there's a typo causing module loading failures:

server/routes/billing.js
This typo causes the server to crash during route loading, leaving zombie processes that accumulate over multiple test runs.

After these fixes, your 15-second timeouts should resolve completely.
