# Jest Parse Failure Issue

**Date**: 2025-01-22  
**Milestone**: R2 (OpenAI Integration)  
**Issue**: Jest unable to parse test file due to markdown artifacts

## Root Cause
Markdown commentary text was accidentally injected at the top of `tests/chat.test.js`:
```
The changes involve updating the Jest mock in tests/chat.test.js to return a valid choices array for happy-path tests and updating the test mocks accordingly.
```

This caused Jest to fail parsing the file entirely since it expected valid JavaScript starting from line 1.

## Symptoms
- `npm test` fails with syntax errors
- Jest unable to run any test cases
- File appears to have mixed content (markdown + JavaScript)

## Resolution Applied
1. **Cleaned test file**: Removed all markdown artifacts from `tests/chat.test.js`
2. **Fixed file structure**: Ensured file starts with proper `const request = require('supertest');`
3. **Verified imports**: Confirmed all require statements are correct

## Impact
- All unit tests now parseable and executable
- Proper separation between documentation and test code
- Test suite can run successfully

## Prevention
- Keep test files purely JavaScript - no embedded markdown
- Use separate documentation files for test explanations
- Review file contents before committing changes

**Status**: RESOLVED âœ…
